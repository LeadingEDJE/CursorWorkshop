# Cursor Workshop

This is a custom Cursor workshop developed by Leading EDJE to instruct trusted clients and community partners on AI tooling.

The workshop's repo contents are very minimal and consist solely of the slides for the workshop event as well as archived versions of sharable code repositories created together that are not proprietary in nature.
