I want you to read the files for cursor rules in @rules . Think about the root causes of the differences between your implementation and the real one. I do not want you to explicitly define how you would fix or answer this prompt in the rules, but I want you to identify the information that was missing from them that you could have used to get your answer more like the real implementation. Think about how the rules could be improve with implicit information, like pointing to examples or describing desired architecture behaviors better.
