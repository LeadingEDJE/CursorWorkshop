Great! This was a test to see how well the Cursor Agent performs when using rules curated for this repo. I had you recreate an existing feature in this repo at the same point in time before it was really merged. The merge commit for this real feature is b497ebd361bbf445cc70207a9848bfa5d1b68492. I would like you to look at the changes in that real commit and compare them to your un-committed changes in the workspace (the version you made). I want you to identify all deviations between the real version and yours. Describe if they are just simple style differences, or if they would cause different behavior than the real implementation, and all deviations in-between.
